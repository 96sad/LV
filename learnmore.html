                <h1>founded by Vuitton</h1>
                <p class="main-content-desc">The Louis Vuitton label was founded by Vuitton in 1854 on Rue Neuve des
                    Capucines in Paris.[10] Louis Vuitton had observed that the HJ Cave Osilite[11] trunk could be
                    easily stacked. In 1858, Vuitton introduced his flat-topped trunks with Trianon canvas, making them
                    lightweight and airtight.[10] Before the introduction of Vuitton's trunks, rounded-top trunks were
                    used, generally to promote water runoff, and thus could not be stacked. It was Vuitton's gray
                    Trianon canvas flat trunk that allowed the ability to stack them on top of another with ease for
                    voyages. Many other luggage makers later imitated Vuitton's style and design.
                    The company participated in the 1867 Universal Exhibition in Paris.[10] In 1871, Ōyama Iwao became
                    the first recorded Japanese customer, ordering a set of luggage while in Paris as a military
                    observer during the Franco-Prussian War.[12] To protect against the duplication of his look, Vuitton
                    changed the Trianon design to a beige-and-brown stripes design in 1876.[6] By 1885, the company
                    opened its first store in London on Oxford Street.[10] Soon thereafter, due to the continuing
                    imitation of his look, in 1888, Vuitton created the Damier Canvas pattern, which bore a logo that
                    reads "marque L. Vuitton déposée", which translates into "L. Vuitton registered trademark". In 1892,
                    Louis Vuitton died, and the company's management passed to his son.[6][10]<br><br>According to a
                    Millward Brown 2010 study, Louis Vuitton was then the world's 19th most valuable brand, and was
                    estimated to be worth over US$19 billion.[37] For six consecutive years, Louis Vuitton was number
                    one of the 10 most powerful brands list published by the Millward Brown Optimor's 2011 BrandZ study
                    with value of $24.3 billion. It was more than double the value of the second ranking brand.[38]

                    Louis Vuitton is one of the most counterfeited brands in the fashion world due to its image as a
                    status symbol.[36] Ironically, the signature Monogram Canvas was created to prevent
                    counterfeiting.[39] In 2004, Louis Vuitton fakes accounted for 18% of counterfeit accessories seized
                    in the European Union.[40]

                    The company actively seeks to eradicate counterfeiting, and employs a team of lawyers and special
                    investigation agencies to pursue offenders through the courts worldwide. The company allocates
                    approximately half of its communications budget to counteract counterfeiting of its goods.[6] LVMH,
                    Vuitton's parent company, has described "Some 60 people at various levels of responsibility working
                    full-time on anti-counterfeiting in collaboration with a wide network of outside investigators and a
                    team of lawyers."[41] The company closely controls the distribution of its products.[6] Until the
                    1980s, Vuitton products were widely sold in department stores, such as Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth
                    Avenue. Today, Vuitton products are primarily available at company-owned Louis Vuitton boutiques,[6]
                    with a small number of exceptions noted in upscale shopping districts or inside luxury department
                    stores. Company boutiques within department stores operate independently, and are operated by
                    company managers and employees. LV has an official online store, through its main
                    website.[42]<br><br>
                    On 13 February 2007, Louis Vuitton sent a cease-and-desist order to Danish art student Nadia Plesner
                    for using an image of a bag that allegedly infringed Louis Vuitton's intellectual property rights.
                    Plesner had created a satirical illustration, "Simple Living", depicting a malnourished child
                    holding a designer dog and a designer bag, and used it on T-shirts and posters to raise funds for
                    the charity "Divest for Darfur".[47] On 25 March, the court ruled in favour of LV that the image was
                    a clear infringement of copyright.[48] Despite the ruling, Plesner continued to use the image,
                    arguing artistic freedom, and posted copies of the cease-and-desist order on her website. On 15
                    April 2008, Louis Vuitton notified Plesner of the lawsuit being brought against her. Louis Vuitton
                    demanded $7,500 (€5,000) for each day Plesner continues to sell the "Simple Living" products, $7,500
                    for each day the original cease-and-desist letter is published on her website and $7,500 a day for
                    using the name "Louis Vuitton" on her website, plus legal and enforcement costs.[49]<br><br>
                    In May 2017, media reported on alleged mistreatment of Louis Vuitton exclusive model Ulrikke Høyer
                    who was to appear on a Louis Vuitton cruise show in Kyoto. The 20-year-old model, who, on arrival,
                    measured 91.5 cm (36 in) around her hips, was told she was "too bloated" and "too big" for her
                    ensemble and instructed to drink only water for 24 hours. The model alleged that she was only
                    informed via her agent in France, who received an email including the text "[she] came yesterday in
                    Tokyo to do her final fitting, and she doesn't fit the exact same dress anymore. She has a belly,
                    her face is more puffy [sic] and the back of her dress is open and you can see it is tight." Despite
                    following the instructions, she was eventually excluded from the show. The model stated that she has
                    "received hundreds of messages from models" who have experienced similar mistreatment from the same
                    Louis Vuitton casting director. The casting director denied the allegations and explained the
                    instructions regarding intake of water as a misunderstanding, that the model was instructed that her
                    intake of liquids was to be limited to water.[80][81]<br><br>Louis Vuitton also collaborated with
                    Kanye West in 2009, designing his own limited run of shoes.</p>
